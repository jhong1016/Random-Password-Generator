# Javascript: Password Generator

**Description**

The purpose of this assignment was to create a secure random password generator. This secure password generator functions by prompting the user for the following criteria:

* Desired password length is between a minimum of 8 characters and maximum of 128.
* Will the new password contain lowercase letters?
* Will the new password contain uppercase letters?
* Will the new password contain numbers?
* Will the new password contain special characters?

Once the program has verified that the password length meets the minimum and maximum requirements, it then determines which criteria the user has selected and generates a secure password string based on the user's input. The new password is then displayed in the text area.
